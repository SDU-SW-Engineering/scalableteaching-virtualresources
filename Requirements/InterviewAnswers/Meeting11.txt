Yes

* How do you as an instructor navigate the virtual machines in play (do you have your own user, ssh, keypairs)?
* How do you distribute the virtual machines?
* How do you handle distribution of machine credentials?

## Problems
* Have you had problems with existing solutions?
It was hard to use the virtual machines
	Getting code out of the machine over usb and such
* Have you had to reset machines(i.e. a rollback) due to an error on the machine such as a software issue?
	NA

# Not active user of servers
* Could you imagine integrating virtual machines into your teaching, for things such as making Linux available or to provide preconfigured systems?
	Possibly
* Have you had problems in class that a preconfigured system could solve?


# Creation of machines
* How would you prefer to create virtual machines?
	* Like thru a configuration file handed to a website or script
	* Thru a website with configuration options
	* Thru a shell script 
Thru a website.
* How comfortable would you be using a terminal to create virtual machines?

	(yes)

# Configuration of machines
* What would you need to pre-configure?
	* Software, ports, startup scripts?
	Sure 
* Could you imagine a situation where the machines would run out of space?
	No - but yes as an edge case
* Could you imagine needing to change the base image to have a more complex configuration?
	Yes
* How would you feel about creating machines based on groups and usernames extracted from blackboard(itslearnig)
	Would be great
* Could you see the need for restricting the access rights of the users to something less than full administrator on the individual machines
		

# Distribution of credentials
* How could you imagine informing the students of how to access the system
	* Like thru a website, Mail, direct messages thru blackboard(itslearning)
	Thru the web interface
