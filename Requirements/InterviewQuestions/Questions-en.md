# Existing interaction with virtual servers
* Do you, or have you used virtual servers in your classes?
* A single server for the whole class?
* Servers for groups or for individuals?
* Multiple machines pr group?
* Could class be improved by the introduction of individual virtual machines
* How do you as an instructor navigate the virtual machines in play (do you have your own user, ssh, keypairs)?
* How do you distribute the virtual machines?
* How do you handle distribution of machine credentials?

## Problems
* Have you had problems with existing solutions?
* Have you had to reset machines(i.e. a rollback) due to an error on the machine such as a software issue?

# Not active user of servers
* Could you imagine integrating virtual machines into your teaching, for things such as making Linux available or to provide preconfigured systems?
* Have you had problems in class that a preconfigured system could solve?

# Creation of machines
* How would you prefer to create virtual machines?
	* Like thru a configuration file handed to a website or script
	* Thru a website with configuration options
	* Thru a shell script 
* How comfortable would you be using a terminal to create virtual machines?
* Would you prefer a web interface?

# Credentials
* Do you have a preference for keypairs vs passwords for signing in via ssh
* Do you have experience using the group system in blackboard(itslearning)

# Configuration of machines
* What would you need to pre-configure?
	* Software, ports, startup scripts?
* Could you imagine a situation where the machines would run out of space?
* Could you imagine needing to change the base image to have a more complex configuration?
* How would you feel about creating machines based on groups and usernames extracted from blackboard(itslearnig)
* Could you see the need for restricting the access rights of the users to something less than full administrator on the individual machines

# Distribution of credentials
* How could you imagine informing the students of how to access the system
	* Like thru a website, Mail, direct messages thru blackboard(itslearning)
